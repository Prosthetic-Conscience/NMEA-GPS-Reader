# NMEA-GPS-Reader
This desktop software reads data from commercial GPS modules and displays locked satellites in a polar plot display. This was developed to test modules before integration on commercial radio and telecom systems. It uses a fixed baud rate serial connection, but does support hot swapped USB tro serial adapters. It was built for an early version of the dot.net framework, but should be forward compatible up to release 5.0/1 as the com object model hasn't changed. Later version and Win11 may pose issues however.

This tool originally shipped with the other documentation on the complete assembly, and was one of a set of debug tools. It has been debadged and posted here as the orignal release has been superceded.
